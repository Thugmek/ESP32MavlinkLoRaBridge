# ESP32 Mavlink LoRa Bridge

## Project still Work In Progress

This project is still work in progress. There is no working release, which could
be used in flight hardware, yet.

## About

This repository contains alternative firmware for ELRS ESP32 modules to create
wireless Mavlink bridge between UAV and ground controll station. This is
somethig, what I was never able to achieve with ELRS firmware.

## ELRS sucks

This project was highly motivated by ELRS, which sucks, and by the people on
their Discord, who claim themselves as official support, but are just
incompetent apes.

I bought ELRS RX and TX modules and tried to configure them as a Mavlink
wireless bridge. After hours of investigating on my own and spending more hours
with some jerk on Discord (who probably had never seen the ELRS firmware before, because his recommendations mentioned options completely missing from the
firmware), I claimed that I could write better firmware in a single weekend than
the ELRS community has in years.

To be honest, this claim isn't entirely true. I've been working on it for more
than a weekend, as I also have other things to do in my life.
